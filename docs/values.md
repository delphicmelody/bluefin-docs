Derived from the [Kubernetes Community Values](https://www.kubernetes.dev/community/values/) but with a more hometown feel:

## Distribution is better than centralization

Distributed asynchronous ownership, collaboration, communication and decision making.

## Automation over process

We value time spent automating repetitive work more highly than toil.

## Inclusive is better than exclusive

Broadly successful and useful technologies require different perspectives and skill sets, which can only be heard in a welcoming and respectful environment. Our community respects the time and effort put into a discussion.

## Evolution is better than stagnation

Openness to new ideas and studied technological evolution make us a stronger project.

## Transparency

We endeavour to utilize the latest in open-source technology (like [sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/)) to ensure our users can verify the processes used to build these images. We strive to educate our users by sharing as much data as we can.

## Bias for Action

We strive to prefer stability and correctness, but recognize that we must act to solve problems quickly and efficiently.
