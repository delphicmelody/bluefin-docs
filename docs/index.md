# Welcome to Bluefin

A custom image of Fedora Silverblue, offering a familiar Ubuntu-style desktop.

For end users, it provides a system as reliable as a Chromebook with near-zero maintenance while providing developers with a powerful [cloud-native development mode](bluefin-dx). Built with next-generation technology, for people who need their machines to get work done.

## Is Bluefin for You?

Bluefin is a next-generation Linux desktop that trends toward progressive improvement. The team rigorously and aggressively moves away from legacy technologies as soon as possible to provide the best possible experience.

> Some might be so inclined to say that Bluefin would best serve developers or experienced Linux users, but I would argue that it’s an equally strong contender for new users because of how reliable it is and how well-configured it comes out of the box.

Bluefin is:

- **Flatpak First** - The application model in Bluefin centers on isolated apps that are maintained in Flathub. Applications that do not work well with modern components such as Wayland, Pipewire, Flatpak Portals, etc. may provide a poor experience and are not recommended.
- **Purposely Invisible** - Bluefin is not a distribution. Your relationship is with Flathub, homebrew, and whatever you put in your containers.
- **Optimized for the 96%** - Not the 4% - Bluefin takes a "stronger together" approach towards features. You can always do what you want, but the value comes from sharing best practices. The team doesn't spend much time on edge cases.
- **Proven development model** - Developer experience focused around containers and exposing new Linux users to the [tools used in cloud native](https://www.cncf.io/). See the [Mission Statement](/mission) and [Values](/values) pages for more information.
- **Purposely Focused on Great Hardware** - Bluefin runs best on Linux friendly hardware in order to provide as much of a legacy-free experience for users as possible. The project also wants to support OEMs who sell Linux laptops and desktops, so it strives to run with the best combination of software and hardware. The team does not go out of its way to document or workaround things that compromise the user experience, so in many cases another operating system is the correct choice.

> I'm a [Framework Linux Ambassador](https://community.frame.work/t/framework-linux-community-ambassador-program-launch/57771/) and Bluefin is a community supported option. This is the "halo car", the dream combination I use for my work and personal gear. A Linux friendly vendor with support, a working relationship with Fedora, and an OS that will last for the life of the device. This is the experience we want everyone to have, and it all starts with supporting vendors who care about Linux, it's the only way it can be sustainable long term.

If your requirements are outside of this scope, then **Bluefin might not be the best fit for you**. Bluefin may cause discomfort and disembowelment [when held incorrectly](/FAQ/#am-i-holding-bluefin-wrong). We recognize that in order to make a better desktop, many parts of the traditional Linux desktop experience will not be coming with us. Check the [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct).

:::info[Begin your journey...]

Bluefin is designed for people who do not want to care about their computer. For traditional users it offers a fresh start. Despite the dinosaurs, the project doesn't hang onto the past—it strives to improve skill sets continuously based on the technology in the field. Since Bluefin is built with cloud-native tools, it shares the same culture—the project strives to automate the toil as far away from the user as possible. If this appeals to you, then Bluefin is for you!
