:::info[Mission Statement]

Accelerate operating system development by integrating with the cloud native ecosystem, in order to provide an on-ramp for new open source contributors.

:::

## Commitment to the Ecosystem

- Focus on improving the upstream experience with existing distributions instead of building a custom distribution:
  - Flathub
  - Homebrew
  - Fedora CoreOS / CentOS Stream
- Take a "distroless" approach to images, the project should be invisible
- Actively encourage upstream contribution by intentionally limiting scope

## Community and Project

- Strive to be a well-managed open-source project.
- Decentralized governance in line with what people expect:
- The project should be able to pass most open source project health checks a typical OSPO would use when doing due diligence. The team is not there yet but it's an achievable goal.
  - Project resources designed to be shared and decentralized, no BDFL-like structures.
- Goal to join a foundation or cooperative that can ensure long-term viability of the project.
- Ensure that transparency goals are met, long-term trust is a goal, so processes must be in place to avoid the bus factor.
- A well structured and diverse Community:
- Explicit Community Values and Code of Conduct.

## Project Non-goals

- The project strives for a minimalistic approach to serve the audience that is currently not using Linux. The project targets the 96%, not the 4%:
- Focus on long-term sustainability of the installation
- A fraction of a computer's life is day 0-3, the project purposely invests in the idea that this installation should last for the life of the hardware
- The project will be brutal about making things out of scope. There is no extra work for no reason, as SRE/cloud-native people the team will embrace being lazy and automating the world, not writing custom installers to partition people's disks, there ain't time for that
- If the team has to make a thing, it's because there is no choice, and if it does have to make it, it's not happy about it.
- The project is mostly feature complete and not making major changes. Not quite "maintenance mode" but also not significantly adding code. The team front loads saying "No" to keep the project lean.
- The goal is to give people what they want with a focus on sustainability and maintenance, more like "My expert linux friend set up my Fedora for me" than a fork or derivative.
- Members of the team have multiple decades of linux distro experience, distros are hard, so the team is not making a "Linux distro."
