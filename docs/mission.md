:::info[Mission Statement]

Accelerate operating system development by integrating with the cloud native ecosystem, in order to provide an on-ramp for new open source contributors.

:::

## Commitment to the Ecosystem

- Focus on improving the upstream experience with existing distributions instead of building our own:
  - Flathub
  - Homebrew
  - Fedora CoreOS / CentOS Stream
- We take a "distroless" approach to our images, we should be invisible
- Actively encourage upstream contribution by intentionally limiting our scope

## Community and Project

- Strive to be a well-managed open-source project.
- Decentralized governance in line with what people expect:
- We should be able to pass most open source project health checks a typical OSPO would use when doing due diligence. We're not there yet but it's an achievable goal.
  - Project resources designed to be shared and decentralized, no BDFL-like structures.
- Goal to join a foundation or cooperative that can ensure long-term viability of the project.
- Ensure that we're meeting our transparency goals, long-term trust is a goal for us, so we have to have processes in place to avoid the bus factor.
- A well structured and diverse Community:
- Explicit Community Values and Code of Conduct.

## Project Non-goals

- The project strives for a minimalistic approach to serve the audience that is currently not using Linux. We target the 96%, not the 4%:
- Focus on long-term sustainability of the installation
- A fraction of a computer's life is day 0-3, we purposely invest in the idea that this installation should last for the life of the hardware
- We will be brutal about making things out of scope. We're not going to do extra work for no reason, as SRE/cloud-native people we will embrace being lazy and automating the world, not writing custom installers to partition people's disks, we ain't got time for that
- If we have to make a thing, it's because we have no choice, and if we do have to make it, we're not happy about it.
- The project is mostly feature complete and not making major changes. Not quite "maintenance mode" but also not significantly adding code. We front load saying "No" to keep the project lean.
- We want to give people what they want with a focus on sustainability and maintenance, more like "My expert linux friend set up my Fedora for me" than a fork or derivative.
- Members of the team have multiple decades of linux distro experience, distros are hard, so we're not making a "Linux distro."
