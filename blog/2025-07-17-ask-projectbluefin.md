You may have noticed this on the docs header lately:

[![header]](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe827152-c863-4d09-9d1f-7b9ce34b69b3)

We are using [deepwiki](https://deepwiki.com/) to index the documentation and then provide a chat tool for you. For example you can ask it [How do I update Bluefin?](https://deepwiki.com/search/how-do-i-update-bluefin_c417348b-6486-43e7-a751-beae48012c06) and so on.

I've been playing with it enough that we've decided to just make it live at [ask.projectbluefin.io](https://ask.projectbluefin.io). Enjoy!
