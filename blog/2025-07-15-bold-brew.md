Alright, this tool just added linux support like three weeks ago, so when I saw it I had to call dibs. the `/` search is awesome, and you can do full package management. You have just leveled up your TUI game. :smiling_face_with_horns:

This is landing in Bluefin this week, if you want it now:

``` 
brew install Valkyrie00/homebrew-bbrew/bbrew 
bbrew
```
