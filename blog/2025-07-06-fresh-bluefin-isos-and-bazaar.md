## A Midsummer Night's Nightmare

This month we return to our pleasant July savannah, our first ever dinosaur wallpaper! There will be a brand new one for August, so enjoy the serene pastures while you can. Today is all about ISOs:

## Fresh ISOs

We've refreshed all of the ISOs, Anaconda and Readymade, you can always find them on the website and the download page:

The build went pretty smooth, we'll likely turn these on to automatically refresh every month or so.

## Bazaar

This is also the first time that Bazaar is shipping on our installation media, we hope that exposing application donation pages and download metrics will help encourage folks to donate to the apps they love!

We have a working Flatpak and hope to submit to Flathub soon so everyone can enjoy! This thing is so fast I am never giving this app up, it's become a necessary part of my kit!

This is the latest weekly snapshot, hope you enjoy! Note to you Bluefin GTS users that you're still stuck with the old installer and old software store, but at least you'll get it all when it's mostly finished. :smiley:
