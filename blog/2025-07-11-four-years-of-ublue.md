A little over four years ago some of my fellow ex-Ubuntu friends helped me complete the first prototype for [Bluefin](https://projectbluefin.io). It was our pocket vision of a "what if we could start over and make exactly what we want?". For you archaeologists, here's [the first version](https://github.com/castrojo/ublue/tree/e0f113a98b98bb0782ecf9314e5348b60d7f2357).

Technically a day early but we intend to make this a weekend long celebration. [Eighteen months later](https://github.com/castrojo/ublue-image) we would form a community ... [Universal Blue](https://universal-blue.org), with the goal to provide modern Linux operating systems for the next generation of open source users and contributors.


Now we have [Bazzite](https://bazzite.gg/), [Aurora](https://getaurora.dev/), and [Cayo](https://github.com/ublue-os/cayo). Finally, the tools to make our own fate. :smiling_imp: I don't have anything especially insightful to say other than thanks! Let's take a quick look at where we stand:

We're sitting at about ~25,000 weekly checkins of Universal Blue systems, and now that we have sort of functional installers, who knows how fast we can grow!

As Kyle mentioned in the [Bazzite update](https://universal-blue.discourse.group/t/bazzite-july-2025-update-bazaar-z13-kernel-6-15-steam-hardware-survey/9501) our communities continute to grow as well! We're now well over 30 million pulls of our images (we kind of stopped counting that). Here's the contributor stats:

Here's our rolling totals:

- **Core contributions:** 61 individuals
- **Contributors:** 1098 individuals
- **Participants:** 3069 individuals
- **Visitors:** 13469

And as we can see, the amount of contributions since Bazzite started to gain traction has really improved. I'm particularly proud of our contributor distribution here - it proves that non-code contributions around support can help keep our project healthy:

(This chart is measuring the partial month of July, ignore that drop off we're not collapsing. :smiley: )

You have my thanks, you've made my operating system invisible, it has been a pleasure destroying the Linux desktop with you. :blue_heart:

### Bluefin

Today is also Bluefin's fourth birthday. I suppose as the first product she was the one who would push the hardest, and will always strive for the pure bootc experience. The dinosaurs remind us that we need to force change in order to achieve the best possible desktop we can. Here's a peek at something special:

I was unfortunately unable to find out the lifespan of a _Deinonychus_, so we'll have to just roll with it.

Things are pretty calm right now, Bazaar is in and once that gets put into Flathub we can chill more. There's plenty of folks on what we call "chillops": they rotate out and relax while the automation hums along for a while.

But also now is the time when the new folks start to step up, so it's encouraging to see people come in and drive for a while. Bluefin LTS is looking pretty good, probably on track for fall GA but we're not in a rush. Next major effort will be adding F43 as beta channels and cycling back into release mode. The game has not started. The clue is: `Winnower`

### Thanks

This work wouldn't be possible without [Timoth√©e Ravier](https://github.com/travier) and the [bootc](https://github.com/bootc-dev/bootc) team! You have our thanks.
